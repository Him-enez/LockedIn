## Inspiration 
After struggling to focus during study sessions or simply doing chores, I noticed how "1 game of Clash Royale" became 10 or how "5 minutes of TikTok" would become an hour. So I thought about making a timer that gamifies tasks that need to be done.

## What it does
LockedIn allows the user to set a time, and during or before that time, the user is able to create a To-Do List of the tasks they are wanting to accomplish in that time frame. As each task gets completed the user is able to check it off, if the user checks off all of the tasks there is a 25xp bonus. After each timer finished the user is awarded xp scaled to the duration of the timer. In order to promote consistency and effort LockedIn has levels that works through the xp points and a streak that tracks days in a row of use. It also uses Firebase to allow for user authentication to store progress through different devices or browsers.

## How I built it
I built LockedIn by asking ChatGPT what is the best languages in order to build this idea I had. Then I went to Visual Studio Code and downloaded Google Gemini Code Assist, Copilot, and LiveServer. From there I looked up the syntaxes and would get guidance from ChatGPT, Google Gemini Code, and Copilot. From there I was able to get the bare minimum logic and interface down. I would test on LiveServer and slowly added in more and more features and used the sources in order to tackle problems as they arised. From there I used Firebase to get the website up and running.

## Challenges I ran into
Getting the project to become a website even with the help of Firebase, was difficult. There was many little problems that took me a while see, for example one of the times there was errors and it was due to my html file being capitalized. There was also many times I would add a new feature and one that had previously been working, would not work.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
I am proud of building my first ever project and website while also becoming familiar with css and JavaScript. Another accomplishment I am proud of is participating in my first Hackathon. Lastly, I am proud that I built software that I will use in my everyday life and hopefully someone else's as well.

## What I learned
I learned many of the syntaxes for JavaScript and how it works with html and css. I also learned how to build a website from scratch. I also learned how to work with Firebase and how to use AI in order to learn at a really efficient and fast pace.

## What's next for LockedIn
Cleaning up the interface, patching any bugs that get discovered, and adding any features that can help me or anyone else out!
